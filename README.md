# fnaf-2-godot

A Godot Engine remake of the popular 2014 game [Five Nights at Freddy's 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/332800/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_2/).<br>

> <strong>I am not aiming for this to become a 1 to 1 clone, just a basic game that imitates the mechanics of the original and aims to serve as an example project for people looking to make a 3D FNAF fanmade game in Godot.</strong>
