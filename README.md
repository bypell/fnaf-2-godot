# fnaf-2-godot

A basic game that imitates some of the mechanics of the popular 2014 game [Five Nights at Freddy's 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/332800/Five_Nights_at_Freddys_2/) and aims to serve as an example project for people looking to make a 3D FNAF fanmade game in Godot that incorporates similar mechanics.

## Features
- Animatronics
- Main menu
- Game Over screen
- Customizable office view panning
- Monitor/Cameras with toggleable flashlight
- Toggleable left/right vent lights and desk flashlight
- Mask

## Planned features
- Making better use of composition instead of inheritance for the animatronics (potentially with nodes or custom resources)
- Security door(s) (because my older fnaf 1 example project is outdated)
- And potentially more stuff

## Important notes
> <strong>The objective of this project is not to replace the original game nor to create a comprehensive/complete/good fangame. The only goal is to make a project that can be used to see how some of the original  game's mechanics can be implemented in Godot.</strong>
